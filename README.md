This project aims to analyze income determinants, exploring the interplay of various demographic, personal, and professional factors. With a dataset consisting of 32,561 records and 15 features, our goal is to unravel the complexities of salary classificationsâ€”categorized as either surpassing $50,000 or falling at or below this threshold. Income disparities are a major concern, influenced by a myriad of factors spanning personal demographics, educational backgrounds, and experiences.
