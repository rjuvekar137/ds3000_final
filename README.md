<h1 align="center"> Predictive Analysis of Salary Classifications: <em> The Influences of Demographics and Professions </em> </h1>

<h2>About</h2>
This project analyzes the effect of income determinants, including demographic, personal, and professional factors. With a dataset comprising 32,561 records and 15 features, we aim to unravel the complexities of salary classifications—categorized as either surpassing $50,000 or falling at or below this threshold. Income disparities are a major concern, influenced by factors spanning personal demographics, educational backgrounds, and experiences.
